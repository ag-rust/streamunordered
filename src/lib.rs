// StreamUnordered is implemented using two linked lists. One which links all
// streams managed by a `StreamUnordered` and one that tracks streams that have
// been scheduled for polling. The first linked list is not thread safe and is
// only accessed by the thread that owns the `StreamUnordered` value. The
// second linked list is an implementation of the intrusive MPSC queue algorithm
// described by 1024cores.net.
//
// When a stream is submitted to the set, a task is allocated and inserted in
// both linked lists. The next call to `poll_next` will (eventually) see this
// task and call `poll` on the stream.
//
// Before a managed stream is polled, the current context's waker is replaced
// with one that is aware of the specific stream being run. This ensures that
// wake-up notifications generated by that specific stream are visible to
// `StreamUnordered`. When a wake-up notification is received, the task is
// inserted into the ready to run queue, so that its stream can be polled later.
//
// Each task is wrapped in an `Arc` and thereby atomically reference counted.
// Also, each task contains an `AtomicBool` which acts as a flag that indicates
// whether the task is currently inserted in the atomic queue. When a wake-up
// notifiaction is received, the task will only be inserted into the ready to
// run queue if it isn't inserted already.
